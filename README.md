# React-Photography

Personal photography website that is currently being built.
Documenting the experiences as they unfold through my world travels.

## Documenting Challenges
I want to keep the website ultralight for fast loading, therefore I want to keep the code seperate from the images. Due to the following challenges I encountered the current solution is to use `https://docs.google.com/uc?+fileID`.

challenges faced:
* Google drive API hosting has been depricated since 8/16
* Dropbox API hosting has been depricated; however, does allow a limited of 4hrs temporary hosting before link is dead.
* Flickr API allows hosting; however, there are limited sizes availible to be displayed.
* Mongodb not feasible for what I want accomplished. Storing images in database is tedious since I constantly change and update photos.
* FileSystem is not ideal with limited space on local storage
